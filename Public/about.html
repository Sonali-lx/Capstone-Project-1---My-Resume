<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student of SASTRA Deemed University, pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering. I aspire to become a 
Software Developer, so apart from my everyday studies, I've taken up online courses to increase my knowledge.</p>

<p>I was born in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India. Dr. R. Senthilkumar and Dr. M. Jaya are my parents, who are both doctors. I have 
a sister, Sowmya, who has completed her B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I've studied invarious 
schools, which helped me socialize in new places easily and expand my network.</p>

<p>I'm active and enthusiastic. I always carry myself with a positive attitude. I love to help as much as I can for 
my peers and for society. My dream is to create software that makes the lives of ordinary people easier at an 
affordable price. I'm working earnestly to make my dream come true, and I believe in the Almighty, who will make 
it happen.</p>
